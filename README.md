This repo demo-diff was created to explore all the possible variations of the git diff command.
__git diff__ command allows you to see changes that were made to a git object by comparing the changes between the before and after states.

__git diff__ allows you to see the difference between:
    1. Changes version in the workspace (working directory) vs the index.
    2. Changes version in the index vs commit history
    3. Changes between two commits in the commit history.
    4. Changes done to a file.
    5. Changes between branches.
