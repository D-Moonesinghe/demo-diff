This repo demo-diff was created to explore all the possible variations of the git diff command.
__git diff__ command allows you to see changes that were made to a git object by comparing the changes between the before and after states.

__git diff__ allows you to see the difference between:
   1  Ex1: Working Directory & Index    : git diff
    1. Ex2: Index vs Repo (commit history)  : git diff --staged
    2. Ex3: Working Directory vs Repo : git diff HEAD
    3. Ex4: Between two different commits  : git diff commit1 & commit2
    4. Ex5: Between two different files in the working directory
    5. Ex6: Between two different sub-directories
    6. Ex7: Between two different branches
